    <p>
        Subvera respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Subvera
        mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Storage</h2>

    <p>
        Subvera does not collect or store personal data on its own servers.
    </p>

    <p>
        All subscription-related data you enter is stored locally on your device and automatically synced using your
        private iCloud account.
    </p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>

    <p>
        Subvera uses Apple’s iCloud service to sync your app data across your devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        This syncing is enabled by default and uses your private iCloud storage. Subvera does not have access to your
        iCloud data and cannot view, access, or process it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data stored in iCloud is protected by Apple’s security and privacy mechanisms and is associated with your Apple
        ID.
    </p>

        Subvera does not access or control the data collected by AdMob.
    </p>

    <h2>Ad Personalization</h2>

    <p>
        Advertisements shown in Subvera may be personalized or non-personalized depending on your device settings and
        regional regulations.
